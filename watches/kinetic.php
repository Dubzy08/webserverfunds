            Kinetc watches have a very particular way of working. This type of watch is<br>
            basically the combination of an automatic watch and a quartz watch. This is<br>
            because the majority of the watch is built with mechanical equipment which<br>
            is used to charge it. However, instead of charging a spring, the watch charges<br>
            a capacitor which allows a mini circuit to work in parallel in the watch. This<br>
            functionalit also gives the watch a unique feature. It is able to stop running<br>
            when the user is not wearing it anymore but keeps the time nonetheless and<br>
            returns to the actual time when the user puts it back on.
