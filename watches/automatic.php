            A lot like a mechanical watch, an automatic watch has no batteries and its main<br>
            power bank is a reverse coiled spring which decoils as time passes by. The only<br>
            difference is that there is a mechanism inside the watch that automatically recharges<br>
            the watch when it moves around.
            <br><br>
