            Solar watches work a lot like quartz watches in the sens that they have a<br>
            battery which is used to hold the power of the watch and make it tick ever<br>
            second. However, it charges from the help of light radiation, a lot like <br>
            solar pannels.
            <br><br>
            Here we can have an idea of how the light is concentrated in the watch:<br>
