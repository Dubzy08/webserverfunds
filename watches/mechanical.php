            A mechanical watch is a watch that has no batteries or mini circuits inside.<br>
            The way it works is that a spring called the Main Spring holds energy by being<br>
            sprung in the oppsite direction. This spring desprings as the time goes by.<br>
            To recharge the watch, you must manually turn the crown which will respring the watch.
